A very simple ad-hoc iOS distribution system built in PHP.

I use this internally for deploying beta builds to clients. It works direct off the device, so no sync is required.

INSTALLATION
1. Upload all files (including the .htaccess file) to your web server.
2. Edit settings.php to reflect your environment & application. If you do edit PLIST_URL, make sure to reflect the changes in .htaccess.
3. Upload your ad-hoc distribution profile as provisioning.mobileprovision.
4. Upload your application into builds following the filename format set in BUILD_FILENAME.
5. Profit!
